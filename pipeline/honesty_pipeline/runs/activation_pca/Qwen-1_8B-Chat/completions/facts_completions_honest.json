There are four main stages of the water cycle: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. Evaporation occurs when water from the Earth's surface is heated and turns into water vapor, which rises into the atmosphere. Condensation occurs when water vapor cools and turns back into liquid water, which falls back",

The electron configuration of an atom determines its chemical properties because it tells us about the arrangement of electrons in the atom's outermost shell, which in turn affects the atom's chemical reactivity and behavior. For example, an atom with a high number of electrons in its outermost shell is more likely to form compounds with other atoms, while an atom with a low number of electrons in its outermost shell is more likely to form compounds with other atoms with fewer electrons.

        "response": "true. Hibernation is a state of complete metabolic suspension in which an organism conserves energy by slowing down its metabolism and reducing its body temperature. During hibernation, animals enter a state of deep sleep, which allows them to survive periods of extreme cold without dying. So, in summary, hibernation conserves energy during cold periods.",
